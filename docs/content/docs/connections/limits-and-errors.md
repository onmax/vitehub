## Storage and security

- Grants are sealed with AES-GCM and the encryption key. Each row stores the key id. With a different key, the status is `needs-reconnect`.
- The connect flow uses PKCE (`S256`), a single-use ticket that expires after 10 minutes, and a `state` cookie. Tokens never go to the browser or the CLI.
- Connect, callback, and management routes exist only when the Console is enabled. Console Auth protects them in production. With an explicit production access contract, the Console is read-only for Connections until you set `console: { manageConnections: true }`. See [Connections in the Console](/docs/development/console#enable-the-console).
- The Console preserves the Vite `base` in management, connect, callback, and return URLs.
- Concurrent refreshes use a database lease, so only one request refreshes a rotating refresh token.

## Errors

| Code | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `CONNECTIONS_NOT_CONFIGURED` | The database or the encryption key is missing. |
| `CONNECTIONS_INVALID` | The management or connect request is not valid, or the ticket or `state` does not match. |
| `CONNECTIONS_NOT_FOUND` | No Connection Definition has this name. |
| `CONNECTIONS_MISSING` | The Connection is not connected. |
| `CONNECTIONS_NEEDS_RECONNECT` | The provider rejected the refresh token. |
| `CONNECTIONS_KEY_MISMATCH` | The grant was sealed with a different key. |
| `CONNECTIONS_DENIED`, `CONNECTIONS_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` | Access rules blocked the call. |
| `CONNECTIONS_ORIGIN_NOT_ALLOWED` | The request URL is not in the provider `origins`. ViteHub did not send the credential. |
| `CONNECTIONS_PROVIDER_FAILED` | The provider returned an error. `details.status` has the HTTP status. |
| `CONNECTIONS_UNAVAILABLE` | Another request holds the refresh lease. Try again. |

When you change the provider of a Connection, the stored grant belongs to the old provider. The status becomes `needs-reconnect` with `lastError: 'CONNECTIONS_PROVIDER_CHANGED'`, and ViteHub never sends that grant to the new provider. Reconnect the Connection.
